OpenQuake-risk has been developed by the scientific members of the GEM Model 
Facility, following an extensive review of existing software to calculate 
seismic risk due to physical damage to buildings \citep{crowley2010}.

\section{OpenQuake-risk: main concepts}
OpenQuake-risk is coded in the Python programming language and is currently 
linked to OpenQuake-hazard, but there are plans to allow users to input 
their own hazard in the future. The procedure to calculate risk outputs is 
currently as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Read the hazard input files, the physical vulnerability model input 
file, the exposure model input file and the calculation settings.

\item Combine the ground motions from OpenQuake-hazard (either from hazard 
curves or ground motion fields depending on the calculation workflow) with 
the physical vulnerability for each asset defined in the exposure model, 
to calculate the losses to the assets.

\item Post-process the losses in an appropriate manner, depending on the 
calculation type, to produce loss curves, maps and statistics due to 
physical damage to buildings. 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Calculation Workflows}
OpenQuake currently comprises three risk calculation workflows: one 
computing losses due to a single event, and the other two computing seismic
risk due to most or all of the possible events that might occur in a given 
region within a certain time span. The calculation workflows are comprised of a number of separate calculators. In order to run any of the calculation workflows, it is necessary to define the geographic coordinates of the region of interest, the type of calculations, the path to the input files (physical vulnerability and exposure models), the type of results that are to be produced and several parameters necessary for the hazard calculations. Currently, a configuration file to be provided to OpenQuake incorporates this information.

The following three calculation workflows are thus supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Deterministic Event-Based Risk}: this calculation sequence is capable of computing losses and loss statistics due to a single,
deterministic earthquake, for a collection of assets (see Figure \ref{fig:Scheme_detrisk_calc}). Such analyses are of importance, for example, for emergency management planning and for raising societal awareness of risk.

\label{fig:Scheme_detrisk_calc}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Probabilistic Event-Based Risk}: this calculation workflow computes the probability of losses and loss statistics for a collection of
assets, based on the probabilistic hazard (see Figure \ref{fig:Scheme_probrisk_calc}). The losses are calculated with an event-based approach, such that the total, combined losses to a set of assets can be calculated. It is noted that cumulative loss exceedance curves, which present the probability of exceedance of cumulative losses within a given time span are not yet supported in OpenQuake.

\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Classical PSHA-Based Risk}: this calculation workflow leads to the computation of the probability of losses and loss statistics for
single assets, based on the probabilistic hazard (see Figure \ref{fig:Scheme_classrisk_calc}). The output of this calculator is useful for comparative risk assessment between assets at different locations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Workflow of the classical PSHA-based risk calculations.}
\label{fig:Scheme_classrisk_calc}
\end{figure}

The hazard calculators in the aforementioned workflows have already been described in the hazard section of this book, and so the following chapters focus on the input, the calculators required for the three distinct workflows (i.e. deterministic event-based risk calculator, probabilistic event-based risk calculator and classical PSHA-based risk calculator) and their output.
