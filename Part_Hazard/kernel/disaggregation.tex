%
Seismic hazard disaggregation - or deaggregation - 
\citep{mcguire1995,bazzurro1999} is a procedure aimed at identifying the 
contributions to a particular level of hazard at specific site -
produced by different combinations of basic variables - such as magnitude
and rupture-site distance - characterizing either the ruptures in the 
\gls{acr:erf} or the selected ground motion models.
%
Two are the main typologies of disaggregation currently adopted in PSHA 
studies (see for example \citet{petersen2008}): the m-r-$\epsilon$ 
disaggregation and the geographic disaggregation. 
%
Conceptually there are no differences between them; 
simply, in the geographic disaggregation the source-to-rupture 
distance is replaced by the position of the point used to calculate
the distance to the site.

Figure \ref{fig:mde_disaggregation} shows a 3-D plot representing the 
contribution to hazard provided by distinct discrete combinations of 
magnitude, distance and $\epsilon$. The usual information that can be
extracted from this plot is the dominant m-r couple \citep[for a 
discussion on this topic see][]{bazzurro1999}, that is the couple of 
parameters giving the highest contribution to the hazard disaggregated 
(i.e. the highest conditional exceedance probability).

In \gls{acr:oq} we introduced a number of alternative disaggregation 
typologies that should help the modeller in better understanding the 
PSHA models and controlling the results provided for specific sites.
% 
In particular, we added the tectonic region and the seismic source type 
to the classical disaggregation variables (i.e. magnitude, distance and
epsilon); this way it will be possible to clearly identify the 
contributions to hazard coming from a several different combinations 
of variables and source and/or ground motion model attributes.
%
Indeed, the disaggregation methodologies implemented in \gls{acr:oq} is 
flexible enough to provide the disaggregation type according to the 
modeller's needs.
% 
\gls{acr:oq} supports disaggregation based on the classical PSHA 
methodology as well as on the event based methodology one. In the 
following sections we describe the details of the approaches
implemented.

\subsection{Disaggregation methodology}
From a calculation point of view, disaggregation simply consists 
on systematically collecting the contributions (i.e. conditional 
probabilities of exceedance) to a selected value of hazard into a 
multidimensional matrix (called \gls{disaggregationmatrix}) and  
later to appropriately combine these contributions according to user 
requirements.
Usually only a fraction of the ruptures included 
in an \gls{acr:erf} and located at close distance to the reference site
provides the main contributions to the disaggregated hazard (see also 
Figure \ref{fig:mde_disaggregation}).

The \gls{disaggregationmatrix} used in \gls{acr:oq} contains the
following axes: magnitude (index i), longitude (index j), latitude 
(index k), source (index s) and epsilon (index l).
%
For each rupture the longitude and latitude coordinates corresponds 
to the point on the rupture used to calculate the source-site distance.

\subsubsection{Classical PSHA: examples of application of the 
disaggregation methodology}
%
In case of the classical PSHA methodology, the cumulation of 
contributions in the \gls{disaggregationmatrix} is based on a 
somewhat modified version of Equation \ref{eq:prob_y_ex_one_rup}.
This equation distinctly accounts for inputs to the probability of 
exceedance of $y$ coming from different $\epsilon$ intervals.
%
\begin{equation}
P(Y \geq y|t,rup_{src},\epsilon,site) = 
	P(rup_{src}|t)\,
	P(Y\geq y|rup_{src},\epsilon,site)
\label{eq:prob_y_ex_one_rup_eps}
\end{equation}
%
Equation \ref{eq:prob_y_ex_one_rup_eps} is recursively used to 
calculate (and successively store in the appropriate cell) the 
contributions coming from the ruptures included in 
\gls{acr:erf} and giving a contribution to the hazard at the 
investigated site. 
%
%
\paragraph{Disaggregation in terms of tectonic region}
The disaggregation in terms of tectonic region is probably one of 
the simplest disaggregation from a conceptual point of view. 
%
It consists on cumulating in the disaggregation matrix the probabilities 
of exceedance computed in the innermost summation contained in the 
equation below:
\begin{multline}
P(Y \geq y|t,site) = \\
	1-\prod\limits_{\forall\,src\,\text{in}\,ERF}^{}  
	\left\{
		1-\sum\limits_{\forall\,rup\,\text{in}\,src}^{}
		\biggl[ 
			1-\sum\limits_{\forall\,\epsilon}^{} 
			P(Y \geq y|t,rup_{src},\epsilon,site)
		\biggr]
	\right\}
\label{eq:disaggregation_kernel}
\end{multline}
%
Successively, the calculations of the conditioned probabilities of 
exceedance for each tectonic region are computed using two nested
loops: the first for the tectonic regions defined in the PSHA the 
second for the seismic sources belonging to a given \gls{tectonicregion}. 
%
%
\paragraph{Disaggregation in terms of magnitude, distance and epsilon}
The magnitude-distance-$\epsilon$ disaggregation is, probably, the 
disaggregation typology most frequently adopted. 

Figure \ref{fig:mde_disaggregation} shows an example of this disaggregation
type. In this case it appears clearly that the main contribution to the 
value of hazard disaggregated come from from events of moderate magnitude 
(between 5.5 and 6.0) located at short distance from the site. 
%
This plot also nicely shows how the epsilon values, keeping fixed a 
source-site distance, tends to decrease in contrast with the increase 
of magnitude.

\subsubsection{Event based PSHA: examples of application of the 
disaggregation methodology}
%
In case of the event-based PSHA methodology the disaggregation is extremely 
simple since it consists on the cumulation of the events with specific 
characteristics.

of this disaggregation typologies and comparison with the more classical 
one.
