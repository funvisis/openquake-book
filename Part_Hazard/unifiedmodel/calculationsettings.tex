Calculation settings is an object containing the information necessary 
to compute hazard. Through the calculation settings is possible to 
specify:
\begin{itemize}
\item The geographical coordinates of site (or sites) where to compute the 
hazard and the soil condition at the site (through a V$_{S,30}$ value)
\item The methodology for computing hazard 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Classical PSHA
	\item Event-based PSHA
	\item Deterministic SHA
	\end{itemize}
\item The typology of result expected. Currently OpenQuake computes the 
following results: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Hazard curves
	\item Hazard maps representing the geographic distribution of an intensity 
	measure type with a specified probability of being exceeded in a fixed 
	time span.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
