The \gls{seismicsourcesystem} is the ensemble of one or several 
\glspl{initialseismicsourcemodel} and the \gls{seismicsourcelogictree}.
%
The initial seismic source model is a list of \gls{seismicsourcedata}
(the typologies of sources admitted is described in Section
\ref{hazard:seismic_source_types}).
%
Usually, a seismic source model contains one or several seismic 
sources accounting for distributed seismicity (e.g. area sources, 
grid sources) and - eventually - one or several individual seismic 
sources.

The \gls{seismicsourcelogictree} describes the epistemic uncertainties 
associated with the parameters used to characterize the Initial 
Seismic Sources models. 
% 
Though this logic tree the user can take into account the epistemic
uncertainties associated with almost all the parameters characterizing
each source typology. 
% 
Currently OpenQuake contains just a limited number of logic tree
branch set types.

\subsubsection{Seismic Sources Logic Tree}
\label{hazard:source_model_logic_tree}
\index{Logic Tree!Seismic Sources}
%
In the current version of OpenQuake, a \gls{seismicsourcelogictree} can be 
defined according to the following schema:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first branching level is assumed describing one or more "alternative" 
initial seismic source models.
\item Subsequent branching levels define source parameters uncertainties. 
Parameters uncertainties are applied independently to each seismic source 
in a source model. That is epistemic uncertainties are assumed uncorrelated 
between different seismic sources.
\item One branch set can be defined for branching level, thus assuming 
symmetric logic tree definition only.
\end{itemize}
%
The possibility of defining multiple source models in the first branching 
level responds to the need of modern PSHA of considering alternative source 
models (as derived by different expert opinions, for instance). 
%
Subsequent branching levels define the epistemic uncertainties that 
apply to parameters characterizing seismic sources. The  
epistemic uncertainties related to these parameters are implemented as 
\emph{rules}, that is as algorithms describing how this parameter has to be 
modified. 
%
The major advantage of using a rule-based approach is that a user does not 
need to a provide an input file containing a source model definition 
corresponding to a specific epistemic uncertainty, that is instead computed 
and applied on the fly to the initial model.

two alternative source models (Source Model 1, Source Model 2). The second 
branching level defines uncertainties in b value (increment of 0.1, 0.0, -0.1).
The third branching level defines uncertainties in maximum magnitude 
(increments of 0.2, 0.0, -0.2).}

\subsubsection{Supported branch set typologies}
The current version of OpenQuake offers only two built-in typologies of 
branch set. They are only a sample of the possible seismic source model 
epistemic uncertainties, and future versions of OpenQuake will provide 
a broader spectrum of built-in branch sets accounting for distinct 
types of epistemic uncertainties. 

Figure \ref{fig:SourceModelLogicTree} depicts a source model logic tree that 
can be defined with the options currently present in OpenQuake.
%
\paragraph{Gutenberg-Richter b value uncertainties}
This is the \gls{branchset} in the second \gls{branchinglevel} of the 
seismic source logic tree depicted in Figure \ref{fig:SourceModelLogicTree}. 
This \gls{branchset}, contains a number of branches. Each one has associated: 
(1) a differential value to be added or subtracted to the Gutenberg-Richter b 
value of each source as specified in the \gls{initialseismicsourcemodel} and 
(2) a weight.
Within this \gls{branchset} conservation of total moment rate 
(corresponding to the one specified in the initial seismic source model) 
is assumed.
%
\paragraph{Gutenberg-Richter maximum magnitude uncertainties}
For this \gls{branchset} the user can specify for each \gls{branch} a 
value (positive or negative) to be added to the Gutenberg-Richter maximum 
magnitude values. 
%
Within this \gls{branchset} conservation of total moment rate 
(corresponding to the one specified in the initial seismic source model) 
is assumed.
