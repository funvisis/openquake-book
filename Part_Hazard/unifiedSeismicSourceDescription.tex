	\index{PSHA!Input model}
An OpenQuake PSHA input model contains three distinct information blocks organised 
in two main objects: the Seismic Sources System and the GMPEs System. 

These information blocks include: (1) data regarding location, geometry, and 
seismicity properties of seismic sources, (2) details about ground motion 
prediction equations to be  adopted in the calculation, (3) information about 
the epistemic uncertainties related to the two aforementioned points. A fourth 
separate, but important, chunk of information being part of the input are 
calculation settings.

OpenQuake PSHA input models are always defined using two logic tree structures 
where properties are specified branching level by branching level. In particular,
OpenQuake requires two logic-tree structures, one describing epistemic uncertainties 
associated with the creation of the ERF - called Seismic Source logic tree - 
	\index{Logic Tree!Seismic sources}
and one considering the uncertainties connected with the use of GMPEs - called GMPE logic tree. 
	\index{Logic Tree!Ground Motion Prediction Equations}
In cases when epistemic uncertainties are non accounted for, the logic tree structure simply consists of one branching level with just one branch (with weight equal to 1).
%
Further explanations about the way we describe and model logic-trees are provided in section \ref{hazard:logic_tree} at page \pageref{hazard:logic_tree}. 

OpenQuake currently support four types of seismic sources. The description of their main properties - subdivided into source location and geometry and source frequency-magnitude distribution - is provided in Section \ref{hazard:seismic_source_types}. 

The selection of ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) in OpenQuake 
is basically accomplished by specifying a label in a particular file.  
The user can associate a GMPE to each tectonic region considered in the 
analysis (Active Shallow tectonic, Stable Continental etc.). Examples of 
GMPEs selection are provided in section \ref{hazard:gmpe_selection} at page 
\pageref{hazard:gmpe_selection}.

The last, but not less important, block of information characterizing a PSHA 
input model contains calculations settings i.e. parameters specifying the way calculations must be carried out. 
%
The information to be included in this part of the input is strictly related to the properties of the engine. 
%
Section \ref{hazard:calculation_settings} provides an outlook of the hazard specific calculation setting supported by OpenQuake.

\section{GMPEs description}
\label{hazard:gmpe_selection}
OpenQuake provides only hardcoded Ground Motion Prediction Equations and misses of a mechanisms allowing the user to specify new GMPEs. This is something the OpenQuake team may think to introduce in the future. 

For the time being the user in need of a specific Intensity Measure Relationship, can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fork the OpenQuake project from the OQ repository\footnote{ The OpenQuake software repository can be reached here: \hfill \newline  https://github.com/gem/openquake/}, code the new GMPE following the examples available in the OpenQuake and OpenSHA repository and, - if he's willing to share his contribution with the other OQ users - ask to push his modified version of OpenQuake. 
\item Post a ticket on the OpenQuake website \marginpar{this is something I need to check with Ben} 
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:OQ_GMPEs} provides a list of the Ground Motion Prediction Equations supported. The vast majority are GMPEs implemented in OpenSHA with just a couple of developed in the course of the GEM1 project. New GMPEs are expected to be added soon with the contribution of some GEM's Regional Programmes.
