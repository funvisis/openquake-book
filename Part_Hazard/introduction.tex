\Gls{psha} is a methodology to identify the probability that ground motion,
for a site or region, will exceed a given level of intensity in a specified 
time period. Originally formulated in the classic works of \citet{cornell1968} 
and \citet{esteva1968}, the fundamental theory of \gls{acr:psha} has remained 
robust. 
Over the last four decades there have been many developments that have 
increased 
the accuracy and rigour of the process, particularly with respect to the 
treatment of uncertainties.  
%

%
The evolution of methodologies proceeded in parallel with the development 
of instrumental seismology and hardware computing power. Computer codes 
such as EQRISK \citep{mcguire1976} and the sequential versions of SEISRISK
\citep{bender1982,bender1987} traced the advancement of PSHA calculation 
within the last part of the 20th century.

At the present time, many applications of PSHA present particular challenges 
in terms of model complexity and the computationally intensive nature of the 
calculation. The geographical scale of application can strongly influence the 
manner in which certain issues may be addressed. Site-specific PSHA analyses 
for special installations (e.g. nuclear power plants), may require complex and
 detailed input models, as well as extensive characterisation of uncertainty 
in every element of the process. Urban, or local-scale, analysis may not require
 such a complex input model, but will likely introduce the need to consider large
 numbers of sites and incorporate information such a spatial correlation and 
geotechnical microzonation. At the largest (regional) scale, the greatest 
challenges arise due to the computational intensity required to perform analysis 
for, potentially, thousands or tens of thousands of locations. Advanced regional 
PSHA models, such as the UCERF2 model \citep{field2009}, may also require extensive
 treatment of uncertainty and detailed characterisation of source geometry. 
All of the potential applications require powerful calculation facilities and 
sophisticated computational codes.

OpenQuake tries to cover this growing requirement for an accessible,scalable and 
efficient code for PSHA calculation. It's worth noting that the hazard 
component of OpenQuake leverages from OpenSHA (http://www.opensha.org) - 
an advanced, open-source, Java-based platform for conducting Seismic 
Hazard Analysis - and it is currently developed in collaboration with 
the OpenSHA team.

\section{OpenQuake-hazard: main concepts}
Schematically, the procedure that OpenQuake follows to compute probabilistic 
seismic hazard is the following:
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item \emph{Read the PSHA input model - i.e. the union of the 
\gls{seismicsourcesystem} and the \gls{groundmotionsystem} - 
and calculation settings.}
	\index{Seismic Source!System} %%%%%%
	\index{PSHA!Input model} %%%%%%
	\index{Ground Motion!System} %%%%%%
	
	The \emph{Seismic Source System} is an object that contains the 
	information necessary to create one or several Seismic Sources Model, 
	eventually by taking into account the epistemic uncertainties. 
	%
	The Seismic Source System contains:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item One or several \glspl{initialseismicsourcemodel};
	\index{Logic Tree!Seismic Source} %%%%%%
	\item One logic tree - the \gls{seismicsourcelogictree} - describing 
	epistemic uncertainties connected with the objects and parameters 
	characterizing the Initial Seismic Source Models.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The Ground Motion System is an object that contains the information 
	necessary to create (or use) one or several \glspl{groundmotionmodel}, 
	eventually by taking into account the epistemic uncertainties. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\index{Logic Tree!Ground Motion} %%%%%%
	\item One or several ground-motion logic trees, each one describing 
	the epistemic uncertainties connected with the objects and parameters 
	characterizing the \glspl{groundmotionmodel} designated for a specific 
	tectonic region.
	\end{itemize}

%
\item \emph{Process the logic tree structures to account for epistemic 
uncertainties connected with the seismic source and ground-motion and
create Seismic Source Models and Ground Motion Models}.
	\index{Seismic Source!Model} %%%%%%
	\index{Ground Motion!Model} %%%%%%
	
	A Seismic Source Model contains the information necessary to create an 
	\gls{acr:erf} (i.e. the probabilistic seismicity occurrence
	model) without con\-sid\-er\-ing any epistemic uncertainty.
	%
	A Ground Motion Model includes the information 
	necessary to compute hazard using a Seismic Source Model. 
\item \emph{Compute the hazard considering as many Seismic Source Models and 
Ground Motion Models as needed to adequately characterize uncertainties}.
\item \emph{Post-process the results obtained for distinct calculations and
calculate simple statistics}.
\end{enumerate}
%
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Calculation workflows}
% Three types of analysis
The hazard component of OpenQuake-Hazard performs seismic hazard 
analysis (SHA) following various approaches. 
%
Currently three main types of analysis are supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Classical Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (cPSHA)}, 
allowing calculation of hazard curves and hazard maps following the 
classical integration procedure 
(\cite{cornell1968}, \citet{mcguire1976}) as formulated by \cite{field2003}).
\item \textit{Event-Based Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (ePSHA)}, 
allowing calculation of ground-motion fields from stochastic event sets. 
Eventually, classical cPSHA results - such as hazard curves - can be 
obtained by post-processing the set of computed ground-motion fields.
\item \textit{Deterministic SHA (DSHA)}, allowing calculation of ground 
motion fields from a single earthquake rupture scenario taking into account 
ground-motion aleatory variability.
\end{itemize}
Each of these analysis types has a modular structure (see Figure 
\ref{fig:openquake_schema}); this provides the capability of investigating 
all possible intermediate results. Moreover, each calculator can be 
extended independently of the others so that more calculation 
options and methodologies can be easily introduced, without affecting the 
overall calculation workflow. 
Each of the workflows described in the following Sections involves a number 
of calculators, each responsible for a specific task. 
Figures \ref{classical_psha_workflow}, \ref{event_based_workflow}, and 
\ref{deterministic_workflow} schematically depict the different calculation 
workflows.

\subsection{Classical Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis}
\label{section:classicalPSHA}
%
Input data for the classical PSHA consist of a PSHA Input Model (PSHAim) that 
is provided together with a set of calculation settings. 
%
Chapter \ref{chap:hazinp} describes extensively the content of a PSHAim and 
- in particular - the different options for modeling seismogenic sources 
and the option offered to include epistemic uncertainties on both seismicity 
and ground-motion models in the form of a logic tree; Chapter 
\ref{chap:hazinp} also incorporates the description of the logic tree 
structure adopted.

\caption{Workflow for classical PSHA (boxes with an orange border represent the 
calculators). Given a PSHA Input Model 
the Logic Tree Processor is responsible for creating a Seismic Source model
and a ground-motion model. 
The Seismic Source model is then provided to the Earthquake Rupture Forecast 
calculator, which computes the ERF (the list of all earthquake ruptures in the 
source model with their probabilities of occurrence). 
Using the ERF and the GMPEs model the Classical PSHA calculator produces 
curves at the sites of interest.}

% ..............................................................................

As represented in Figure \ref{classical_psha_workflow}, the main calculators 
used to perform this analysis are:
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item \emph{Logic Tree Processor} \hfill \\
The Logic Tree Processor (LTP) takes as an input the PSHA Input Model and 
creates a Seismic Source Model. The LTP uses the information in the Initial 
Seismic Source Models and by 'harvesting' the information contained in the 
Seismic Source Logic Tree - that is to sample the epistemic uncertainties - 
it creates a Seismic Source Model (i.e. a model describing geometry and 
activity rates of each source without any epistemic uncertainty). 
%
Following the procedure just described the Logic Tree Processor creates a 
Ground Motion model (i.e. a data structure that associates to each tectonic 
region considered in the calculation a GMPE).
%
\item \emph{Earthquake Rupture Forecast Calculator} \hfill \\
The produced Seismic Source Model is then used as input for the Earthquake 
Rupture Forecast (ERF) calculator which computes the probability of occurrence, 
over a specified time span, for each earthquake rupture produced by the source 
model.
\item \emph{Classical PSHA Calculator} \hfill \\
The cPSHA uses the ERF and the Ground Motion model to compute hazard curves on 
each site specified in the calculation settings.

\subsection{Event-Based Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis}
\label{section:event-basedPSHA}
Input data for the Event-Based PSHA - as in the case of the Classical PSHA 
calculator - consist of a PSHA Input Model supplied to OQ together with a 
set of calculation settings.
%

\caption{Workflow for event-based PSHA. Similar to the classical PSHA workflow 
(Figure \ref{classical_psha_workflow}), an ERF is computed, which is then used

a region in a given time span). Each event is then utilized to calculate a 
ground-motion field over a region of interest.}
\label{event_based_workflow}
\end{figure}
% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . < Figure
% ..............................................................................
As represented in Figure \ref{event_based_workflow}, the main calculators 
used to perform this analysis are:
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item \emph{Logic Tree Processor} \hfill \\
The Logic Tree Processor was already 
introduced in the description of the cPSHA workflow (see section 
\ref{section:classicalPSHA} at page \pageref{section:classicalPSHA}).
%
\item \emph{Earthquake Rupture Forecast Calculator} \hfill \\ 
The Logic Tree Processor was already 
introduced in the description of the cPSHA workflow (see section 
\ref{section:classicalPSHA} at page \pageref{section:classicalPSHA}).
%
\item \emph{Stochastic Event Set Calculator} \hfill \\
The Stochastic Event Set Calculator generates a Stochastic Event set 
by sampling each rupture contained in the ERF according to its 
probability of occurrence. Usually a Stochastic Event Set (SES) contains
a large number of seismicity histories each one representative of a  
possible collection of events that can be produced by the seismic source
considered in an analysis during the time span fixed for the calculation
of hazard (normally corresponding to 50 years).
%
\item \emph{Ground Motion Field Calculator} \hfill \\
The Ground Motion Field Calculator computes for each event contained in a 
Stochastic Event Set - provided as an input - a realization of the 
ground shaking taking into account the aleatory uncertainties in 
the ground-motion model. Eventually, the Ground Motion Field calculator 
can consider the spatial correlation of the ground-motion during the 
generation of the GMF.
%
\item \emph{Event-based PSHA Calculator} \hfill \\
The event-based PSHA calculator takes a (large) set of ground-motion 
fields representative of the possible shaking that the investigated 
area can eventually experience over a (large) time span and for each 
grid node in a ground-motion fields computes the corresponding hazard 
curve. 
%
This procedure is computationally intensive and is not recommended for 
investigating the hazard over large areas. 
\end{enumerate}

The Logic Tree Processor and the Earthquake rupture forecast were already 
introduced during the descrption of the cPSHA workflow (see section 
\ref{section:classicalPSHA} at page \pageref{section:classicalPSHA}).

\subsection{Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analysis}
\label{section:deterministicSHA}
% Deterministic
For deterministic SHA (DSHA), the input data consist of a single earthquake 
rupture model and a single ground-motion model. Using the Ground Motion Field 
Calculator, multiple realizations of ground shaking can be computed, each 
realization sampling the aleatory uncertainties in the ground-motion model.

As represented in Figure \ref{deterministic_workflow}, the main calculators 
used to perform this analysis are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Ground Motion Field Calculator} \hfill \\
The Ground Motion Field Calculator was already 
introduced during the descrption of the ePSHA workflow (see section 
\ref{section:event-basedPSHA} at page \pageref{section:classicalPSHA}).
