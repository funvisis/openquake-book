In this chapter we discuss the properties of the two main calculators 
needed to process the information contained in the \gls{pshainputmodel} 
and prepare it for calculation: the Logic Tree processor and the 
Earthquake Rupture Forecast calculator. 

In Section \ref{hazard:logic_tree_processor} we describe the logic 
tree processor which takes the PSHA Input Model and creates many 
realisations of a \gls{seismicsourcemodel} and of a 
\gls{groundmotionmodel} while in the following two Sections we concentrate 
on the Earthquake Rupture Forecast Calculator which takes one seismic
sources model - produced by the Logic Tree Processor - and creates 
the \gls{acr:erf}.

\section{The Logic Tree Processor}
\label{hazard:logic_tree_processor}
\index{Logic Tree!Processor}
%
The Logic Tree Processor is responsible for processing data in a 
PSHA input model describing the two logic tree structures
(see Section \ref{hazard:logic_tree}). 
%
The processing consists on the creation of a \gls{seismicsourcemodel} 
from the seismic source logic tree (see Section 
\ref{hazard:source_model_logic_tree}) and one \gls{groundmotionmodel} 
from the ground-motion logic tree (see Section \ref{hazard:gmpe_logic_tree}). 
%
%The seismic source model and ground-motion model created can be then 
%passed to the different OpenQuake-Hazard calculators: the classical PSHA 
%calculator (described 
%in Section \ref{chap:classic_psha}) and the stochastic PSHA calculator 
%(discussed in Section \ref{chap:stochastic_psha}).

The potential difficulty in processing the information in a logic tree 
is constrained by its size, the complexity of the structure and the 
intricacy of the \glspl{branchset} involved.
%
For a large logic tree, performing a seismic hazard calculation for 
all possible end-branch models is an unfeasible task, therefore, 
an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling appears a more efficient and
thus feasible approach. 
%
On the contrary, for a small and simple logic tree, a Monte Carlo 
approach is inefficient with respect to enumerating all the possible 
end-branch models and performing a hazard analysis for each of them. 
%
In other words, to get stable results in case of a simple logic tree, 
a Monte Carlo approach would require sampling epistemic uncertainties 
a number of times much larger than the actual number of end-branch models.
%
The general plan for OpenQuake is to provide both the two processing 
strategies. 

Currently, the logic tree processor can only provide a Monte 
Carlo sampler.

\subsection{The Logic Tree Monte Carlo Sampler}
Aim of the \gls{acr:ltmcs} is to create a set of \glspl{seismicsourcemodel} 
and \glspl{groundmotionmodel} representing exhaustively the combinations 
allowed by the logic tree structures defined by the modeller.
% 
This way the distribution of the final results will reflect 
the degree of uncertainty introduced by lack of precise knowledge 
of parameters and models included in the PSHA input model.

\subsubsection{Sampling the seismic source logic tree}
As described in \ref{hazard:source_model_logic_tree}, the first branching 
level in the source model logic tree is used to define one or more 
alternative source models called \glspl{initialseismicsourcemodel}. 
%
Subsequent branches define parameter-specific epistemic uncertainties. 
\textcolor{red}{Currently} each branching level contains only one 
branch set (therefore producing a symmetric logic tree). 

The \gls{acr:ltmcs} constructs a \gls{seismicsourcemodel} by progressively
processing all the branching levels. In the first branching level, an 
\gls{initialseismicsourcemodel} is randomly selected, with a probability 
equal to the uncertainty 
weight. 
%
Epistemic uncertainties defined in subsequent branching levels are then 
applied to this initially selected source model. For each following 
branching level, a loop over the seismic sources defined in the selected
source model is started, and for each seismic source an epistemic 
uncertainty value is randomly selected (again with a probability equal to 
the uncertainty weight).
