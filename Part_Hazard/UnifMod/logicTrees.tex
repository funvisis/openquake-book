epistemic uncertainties of models and parameters included in a hazard 
analysis.

\index{Logic Tree!Branch set}
A logic tree cont\-ains three main elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Branching Level
\item Branch Set
\item Branch
\end{itemize}
%
A branching level expresses the distance from the root of the logic tree of a 
given element of a logic tree structure; in the simplest case each branching 
level corresponds to a single type uncertainty
(e.g. maximum magnitude). 
Indicatively, we can say that the larger the number of branching levels in a 
logic structure the larger is its complexity.
%
A branch set describes an uncertainty model (for example - as previously 
mentioned - a model accounting for the epistemic uncertainties connected with 
the definition of maximum magnitude), composed of a number of mutually 
exclusive and collectively exhaustive options. 
%
Finally, a branch represent a particular alternative in a branch set and 
therefore it refers to an uncertainty model and has a weight expressing - 
according to different interpretations available in the literature 
- ``probabilities or simply subjective indications of relative merit'' 
\citep[][page 999]{bommer2008}.
	\index{Logic Tree!Branch}

%
In more detail, a branch set - the fundamental component in our logic tree data 
model - consists on (1) the parameter (or model) affected 
by uncertainty, (2) the specification of the type of uncertainty (3) the 
listing of the - mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive 
\citep{bommer2008} - alternative hypotheses (4) a weight for each hypothesis, 
(5) a flag specifying if the branches are (totally) correlated and, (6) the 
index of the branches of the previous level - or the subset of seismic 
sources - to which this branch set applies.

Figure \ref{fig:logic_tree_branching_levels} depicts a branch 
set fixing epistemic uncertainties on the dip angle of simple 
fault sources. In this case the possible values of the dip are specified
on each branch composing the branching set (i.e. 30, 45 and 60 degrees). This 
means that these three values are the only ones admitted for all the sources 
included in the initial seismic source model considered. 
%
Figure \ref{fig:logic_tree_branching_levels_1} also shows a branch
set defining epistemic uncertainties on the dip angle 
of simple fault sources. In this case, however, the values specified for each 
branch aren't absolute dip angles but instead differential values to be added - 
or subtracted - to the initial dip value specified for each simple fault source 
contained in the initial seismic sources model.

Two or more branch sets they can be combined in flexible fashion (i.e. 
concatenated) to create an entire logic-tree structure.
Figure \ref{fig:logic_tree_schema} shows an example of a logic tree 
created by combining the two branch sets described in the upper part of the
figure. 
The first branching level accounts for epistemic uncertainties connected with 
the dip of simple fault sources whilst the second branching level specifies 
the epistemic uncertainties relative to the depth to the top of rupture for 
(this branching level also applies to simple faults included in the model).

%A logic tree structure can then be assembled by concatenating many 
%branch sets in a sequence, each position in this stack being represented 
%by a branching level (see Figure \ref{fig:LogicTreeGeneralStructure}).

\section{Logic-tree description}
\label{hazard:logic_tree}
A logic tree is defined in terms of three main elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Individual Branch}
\item \textbf{Branch Set}
\item \textbf{Branching Level}
\end{itemize}
An individual branch represent a particular realization of an epistemic 
uncertainty, and is therefore defined by an \textbf{uncertainty model} 
and an \textbf{uncertainty weight}. A branch set collects all the individual
branches that describe a particular epistemic \textbf{uncertainty type},
and consequently requires all individual branches' weights to sum to one. 
A logic tree structure can then be assembled by placing branch sets in a 
sequence, each position being represented by a branching level (see Figure 
\ref{fig:LogicTreeGeneralStructure}).
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{./Figures/Part_Hazard/LogicTreeGeneralStructure.eps}
\caption{Logic Tree data structure as defined in terms of individual branches, 
branch sets, and branching levels.}
\label{fig:LogicTreeGeneralStructure}
\end{figure}
The above described parameterization allows for a very general definition of a 
logic tree structure. For instance, a non-symmetric logic tree can be easily 
created by placing multiple branch sets in the same branching level, each 
branch set being connected to a specific branch of a branch set defined in a
previous branching level.
\subsection{Source Model Logic Tree}
\label{hazard:source_model_logic_tree}
In the current version of OpenQuake, a source model logic tree can be defined 
according to the following schema:
\begin{itemize}
\item the 1st branching level is assumed describing one or more "alternative" 
initial source models.
\item subsequent branching levels define source parameters uncertainties. 
Parameters uncertainties are applied independently to each seismic source 
in a source model. That is epistemic uncertainties are assumed uncorrelated 
between different seismic sources.
\item one branch set can be defined for branching level, thus assuming 
symmetric logic tree definition only.
\end{itemize}
The possibility of defining multiple source models in the first branching 
level responds to the need of modern PSHA of considering alternative source 
model creation approaches (as derived by different expert opinions, data sets,
modeling methodologies, for instance). Subsequent branching levels allows 
defining epistemic uncertainties that apply to specific parameters seismic 
sources depends upon. Parameter-related epistemic uncertainties are 
implemented as \textbf{rules}, that is as algorithms describing how 
a certain model parameter has to be altered. The major advantage of 
using a rule-based approach is that a user does not need to a provide 
an input file containing a source model definition corresponding to a 
specific epistemic uncertainty, that is instead computed and applied 
on the fly to the initial model. The current version of OpenQuake offers 
two built-in rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gutenberg-Richter b value uncertainties. The user can specify a set 
of increments (positive or negative) that are added to Gutenberg-Richter 
b values. Conservation of total moment rate is assumed.
\item Gutenberg-Richter maximum magnitude uncertainties. The user can specify
a set of increments (positive or negative) that are added to Gutenberg-Richter 
maximum magnitude values. Conservation of total moment rate is assumed.
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:SourceModelLogicTree} depicts a source model logic tree that 
can be defined with the options currently present in OpenQuake.
%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{./Figures/Part_Hazard/SourceModelLogicTree.eps}
\caption{Example of Source Model Logic Tree. The first branching level defines
two alternative source models (Source Model 1, Source Model 2). The second 
branching level defines uncertainties in b value (increment of 0.1, 0.0, -0.1).
The third branching level defines uncertainties in maximum magnitude 
(increments of 0.2, 0.0, -0.2).}
\label{fig:SourceModelLogicTree}
\end{figure}
%
The above mentioned rules are only a sample of possible source model epistemic 
uncertainties, and future versions of OpenQuake will provide a broader spectrum
of built-in epistemic uncertainties. Currently, rules are applied to all 
sources. Option to apply rules only to specific sources will be also supported 
in the future.
%
\subsection{GMPE Logic Tree}
\label{hazard:gmpe_logic_tree}
The GMPE Logic Tree allows a user to consider multiple ground motion prediction
equations in the hazard modeling. Given that GMPEs are often, or can be, 
associated to specific tectonic region types, OpenQuake allows the definition 
of multiple GMPE logic trees, one for each tectonic region type considered in 
the source model. In the current version, a GMPE logic tree can have only one 
branching level, containing only one branch set, where each individual branch 
is associated to a specific GMPE. With the current setting, epistemic 
uncertainties coming from different models can be taken into account, but 
epistemic uncertainties inside each model cannot be captured.
Figure \ref{fig:GMPELogicTree} schematically shows GMPE logic trees that can 
be currently defined in OpenQuake.
