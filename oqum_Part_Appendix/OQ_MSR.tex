This Appendix reports the magnitude-scaling relationships that can be currently utilized for hazard calculation (to be set in the configuration file for each source typology).
\begin{itemize}
\item \Verb+Wells & Coppersmith (1994)+: implements the magnitude versus area relationships described in \cite{wells1994}.
\item \Verb+W&C 1994 Mag-Length Rel.+: implements the magnitude versus surface-rupture length relationships described in \cite{wells1994}
\item \Verb+PEER Tests Mag-Area Rel.+: implements the magnitude versus area relationship utilized for the PEER PSHA test cases (\cite{thomas2010})
\item \Verb+Hanks & Bakun (2002)+: implements the magnitude versus area relationship described in \cite{hanks2002}
\end{itemize}
